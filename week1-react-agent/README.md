# Week 1 — ReAct Agent

A web-search-powered reasoning agent built with LangGraph's ReAct pattern. Given a question, it searches the web, reasons over the results, and returns a sourced answer.

## Features
- ReAct agent (reason + act loop) using Groq's Llama 3.3 70B
- Live web search via Tavily
- Streamlit UI with:
  - Persistent chat history, grouped by date (saved to local JSON)
  - Expandable source citations for every answer
  - Custom warm-toned theme with an animated mascot that reacts while the agent is thinking

## Files
- app.py — Streamlit demo UI (main deliverable to run)
- week1_first_agent.py — plain terminal version of the same agent
- requirements.txt — Python dependencies
